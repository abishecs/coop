            <h2>Pure Industrial</h2>
            <p>During my four months at Pure Industrial, I gained valuable insights and hands-on experience in various aspects of the workforce, particularly in utilizing software and applications to streamline processes. One of the key tools I worked with was Yardi Voyager, a web-based property management platform tailored for large residential and commercial real estate portfolios. It integrates property management functions such as operations, leasing, analytics, and services for stakeholders. While I briefly interacted with Yardi Voyager, my primary focus was on Workiva, a cloud-based document and data collaboration platform widely used for managing and reporting data in finance, accounting, risk, and compliance.</p>
            <p>I leveraged Workiva extensively to enhance data processes and automation. Initially, my primary responsibility was to resolve outstanding issues left by PwC, the consulting firm that had set up Pure Industrial's Workiva platform. These issues were resolved within the first month, allowing me to focus on optimizing other workflows within Workiva. Key accomplishments during this time included:</p>
            <ul>
                <li><strong>Automating Dataset Integration:</strong> I implemented an automation process to streamline the transfer of datasets from SharePoint to Workiva.</li>
                <li><strong>Asset-Level Surveys:</strong> I developed a process to automate the creation, distribution, and consolidation of asset-level surveys. These surveys provided detailed property-level energy and utility data for Pure Industrial's acquisitions. The workflow included sending surveys to Property Directors, obtaining confirmations from both the Property Directors and the Sustainability Team, and repopulating data within Workiva using its chain feature.</li>
                <li><strong>Scripting and Data Reporting:</strong> Collaborating with Pure Industrial's sister company, I gained access to scripting capabilities. This enabled me to create new datasets and design monthly reports. These reports were uploaded to SharePoint and integrated into Power BI via Power Automate, providing visualizations for all utility types at both property and unit levels.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Additionally, I worked with various Microsoft-based applications, including Power Automate, to facilitate these processes. Although I had prior experience with Power BI, I did not directly engage with it during my tenure at Pure Industrial.</p>
            <p>These contributions significantly enhanced the efficiency and accuracy of data management and reporting at Pure Industrial. While there were other minor tasks I completed, these represent the most impactful and noteworthy achievements during my four-month engagement.</p>
